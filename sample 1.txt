1. Focus on the Fundamentals

Think you don’t need to go over 
the basics?
Think again. Like in
 any field, getting a good
grasp 
of the fundamentals is critically
 important
to achieving long-term 
success. The information you
learn
 at the beginning of your programming 
education
or coding bootcamp will allow
 you to grasp the logic
of more complicated
 topics further along. If you don’t 
learn 
basic computer programming, you could fall 
behind
in the future. So, even if the 
fundamentals seem boring 
or unimportant 
at first, you need to recognize how essential
it
 is to learn them.

2. Learn to Ask for
 Help
Knowing when to ask for help is a
 skill you’ll need throughout
the course 
of your life, not just in your coding career.

 
The fact of the matter is, you aren’t going to
 know everything,
especially when you’re just
 starting out. The fastest and easiest 
way to 
gain the skills you need to have for a successful
 coding 
career is to ask those who have the answers.
 After you try to 
figure out the answer to your question 
on your own, be sure to ask
someone else. Whether you do 
it in person or online, speaking to your
mentor or teacher
 and listening to what they have to say is critical 
when
 you are learning to become a computer programmer.
