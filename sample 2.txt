3. Put Your Knowledge into Action
   If you really want to learn how 
to code, you need to do more than 
just read the book and take some 
notes — you need to put the information
 you’re learning into action. You might
 be surprised at how something you read 
can seem so simple until you try to do it 
for yourself. Therefore, you should actually 
start coding as you’re learning. That way,
 you put the information to use immediately
. When you learn by doing, the information 
will be more likely to stick with you.
