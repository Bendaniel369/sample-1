4. Learn How to Code by Hand
   It might seem old school, 
but if you really want to succeed 
in computer programming, especially 
if you are seeking a coding career,
 learning to code by hand is one of
 the most important skills you can 
learn. First of all, it will make you
 a better coder because you’ll have 
to be more intentional — you won’t 
be able to run your code halfway through 
to see if it works. This results in an 
increased level of precision. But learning
 to code by hand doesn’t just improve
 your skills; it can also help you get 
a job and jumpstart your coding career.
 Employers looking to hire computer 
programmers often require applicants 
to take a coding test that involves 
coding by hand. Therefore, it’s essential
 that you acquire this skill.
